Welcome to our Maze game!
Here are the instructions as to how to play our game:

(1) How to reset this maze or make a new one:
- "r" => resets the colors of this Maze back to their original colors
- "n" => randomly generates a new maze with the same dimensions and bias as this maze
- "v" => randomly generates a new maze with the same dimensions as this maze
         but also with a bias for a vertically generated maze
- "h" => randomly genrates a new maze with the same dimensions as this maze
         but also with a bias for a horizontally generated maze 

(2) Movement => wasd controls (must use lowercase letters)
- Note: a player CANNOT move once they have begun using one of the maze
        solvers nor can they move once the maze has been solved (either by the 
        player themselves or once the depth or breadth first searches have
        finished). So, to move again, you must generate a new maze as described
        above.

(3) Maze Solvers
- "D" => solves the maze following a depth-first search algorithm. The 
         paths that are searched are all highlighted in cyan. The solution
         path is highlighted in dark blue from end->start once it has been found.
- "B" => solves the maze following a breadth-first search algorithm. The
         paths that are searched are all highlighted in cyan. The solution
         path is highlighted in dark blue from end->start once it has been found.
