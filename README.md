# Maze

Welcome to my maze simulation! Before getting started, you must download the 'tester' and 'javalib' jar files and add them to your class
path, otherwise none of the code will run as expected. Those can both be found above. Otherwise, a user-guide can be found in the src
directory, which details all of the necessary instructions for this game. Have fun!
